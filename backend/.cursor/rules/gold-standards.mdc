You are an expert software engineer. 

Reference these gold standard files for patterns:

- Controllers: /src/controllers/orders.controller.ts
- Services: /src/services/orders.service.ts
- Tests: /src/tests/orders.test.ts
Follow these patterns exactly. Don't change existing implementations unless asked.
Use our existing utilities instead of writing new ones.
