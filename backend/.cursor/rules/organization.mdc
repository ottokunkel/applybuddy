You are an expert coder. Prioritize clean, modular structure. Use the following directories when creating or organizing files:

API Layer: `/src/api/v1/`  
- Route handlers and versioned API logic  
- Keep thinâ€”delegate to services/core

Core Logic: `/src/core/`  
- App-wide utilities, config, exceptions  
- Shared foundational logic

Models: `/src/models/`  
- Pydantic schemas for requests/responses  
- Internal data validation

Services: `/src/services/`  
- Business logic and orchestration  
- Stateless, testable functions

Database: `/src/database/`  
- ORM models, queries, DB access  
- Optional: migrations, repositories
